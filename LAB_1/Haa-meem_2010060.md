## 5. Discussion:

In this experiment, the focus was on creating well-structured documentation using Markdown language. The document demonstrated various Markdown features such as headers, emphasis, tables, images, links, and code blocks.

1. **Headers**: Different levels of headers were used, ranging from `Header 1` & `Header 6`, to organize the content in a hierarchical manner. This is important for readability and structuring documents logically.

2. **Emphasis**: Markdown offers multiple ways to emphasize text. Italics were applied using both underscores (`_`) and stars (`*`), while bold text was demonstrated using double underscores (`__`) and double stars (`**`). Additionally, bold and italic combinations were shown to highlight key points within the text.

3. **Strike-through**: The example also illustrated how to apply strike-through to text using `~~`. This can be helpful in situations where one wants to indicate outdated or irrelevant information without removing it.

4. **Links**: Links to external websites were embedded, showing how Markdown simplifies adding hyperlinks without complex HTML tags. This enhances navigation, making the document interactive and resourceful.

5. **Tables**: The inclusion of a table demonstrated how Markdown can organize data effectively in a tabular format. This is especially useful for presenting structured information like comparisons, datasets, or lists.

6. **Images**: Adding images within Markdown was shown by embedding a link to a remote image. This capability allows for visual content to be integrated seamlessly into documents, enriching the user experience.

Overall, this experiment demonstrated the versatility and simplicity of Markdown for creating professional and structured documents. It is particularly useful in environments like GitHub, technical blogs, or collaborative documentation, where quick formatting and readability are key. Markdown’s lightweight syntax allows for swift adoption while maintaining clarity across different types of content.

## 2. Experiment Name:  
Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:  
- To implement best coding practices in JavaScript.
- To write readable, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript code.
- To explore ways to reduce complexity and improve collaboration.

## 4. Source Code and Description:

### **Source Code** (Example in JavaScript):
```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function displayResult(sum) {
    console.log(`The sum is: ${sum}`);
}

let num1 = parseInt(prompt("Enter first number: "));
let num2 = parseInt(prompt("Enter second number: "));

let sum = calculateSum(num1, num2);

displayResult(sum);
```

### **Description**:  
In this JavaScript example, we follow several best coding practices:

1. **Modular Code**: The logic for calculating the sum is separated into a reusable `calculateSum` function, while displaying the result is handled by the `displayResult` function. This modular approach makes the code easier to maintain and extend.
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Variables (`num1`, `num2`, `sum`) and function names (`calculateSum`, `displayResult`) are chosen to clearly convey their purpose.
3. **User Input Handling**: The `prompt` method is used to get user input, and `parseInt` ensures that the input is properly converted into integers.
4. **Code Efficiency**: The functions are designed to be reusable and maintain a clear flow, making the program efficient.
5. **String Interpolation**: The `console.log` statement uses template literals (backticks) for better readability when combining strings and variables.
6. **Separation of Concerns**: By having separate functions for calculation and displaying results, the code maintains a clean separation of concerns.

## 5. Discussion:

In this experiment, we applied **best coding practices** in JavaScript, ensuring that the code is both readable and maintainable. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Modularity**: Splitting tasks into functions (`calculateSum` and `displayResult`) makes the code more modular and reusable. This follows the **single responsibility principle**, where each function does only one task.
   
2. **Descriptive Names**: Choosing meaningful names for functions and variables improves readability. It’s easier for another developer (or your future self) to understand what the code does at a glance.

3. **Input Handling**: Using `prompt` to get input from the user and `parseInt` to convert the input to a number ensures that the program behaves as expected. Validating and sanitizing input is an essential practice in all programs.

4. **Readable Output**: Using template literals (`\``) in JavaScript for the `console.log` statement makes it easier to read and prevents errors when concatenating strings.

5. **Maintainability and Extensibility**: This structure allows easy updates. If more functionality needs to be added (such as validating user input or performing additional calculations), it can be done without affecting other parts of the code.

Following these best practices leads to cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable JavaScript code that is easier to debug and extend, while also improving collaboration when working with other developers.


## 1. Experiment No:
**3**

## 2. Experiment Name:
Study of Different Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:
- To explore the functionality of essential Git commands.
- To learn how to effectively use Git for version control and collaboration.
- To understand the role of different Git commands in managing repositories and project workflows.

## 4. Theory:
Git is a distributed version control system used to manage and track changes in a project's codebase. It allows multiple developers to collaborate seamlessly without overwriting each other’s work. Git operates through repositories, where changes are tracked using commits. Developers often work on different branches and merge their changes later. This experiment focuses on understanding key Git commands and their practical applications.

### Key Git Commands:
1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Copies an existing repository to a new directory.
3. `git status`: Shows the working directory and staging area status.
4. `git add`: Stages changes for the next commit.
5. `git commit`: Records staged changes into the repository.
6. `git log`: Displays the repository's commit history.
7. `git push`: Sends local commits to a remote repository.
8. `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
9. `git branch`: Manages branches within the repository.
10. `git merge`: Combines changes from one branch into another.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a repository**:
   - Use `git init` to create a new repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone an existing repository**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy an existing repository from a remote source.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check the repository status**:
   - Use `git status` to view the current state of the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Stage changes**:
   - Use `git add` to add changes to the staging area.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add filename.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit changes**:
   - Use `git commit` to save changes with a message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to display the commit history.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:
   - Use `git push` to send changes to a remote repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:
   - Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Manage branches**:
   - Use `git branch` to create or switch between branches.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch new-feature
     git checkout new-feature
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Use `git merge` to combine branches.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge new-feature
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check status
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull updates from remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch new-feature

# Merge branches
git merge new-feature
```

### Output:
After running the above commands, you will have a Git repository initialized, changes tracked and committed, and a new branch merged into the main branch.

## 7. Discussion:
In this experiment, we explored basic Git commands that are fundamental for managing and tracking code versions. The following key concepts were demonstrated:

1. **Repository Setup**: We learned how to initialize a new repository with `git init` and how to clone an existing one with `git clone`. This forms the foundation for working on new or existing projects.

2. **Tracking Changes**: The `git status` command helps track the current state of the working directory, while `git add` stages changes for the next commit, making it easier to organize modifications.

3. **Committing and Pushing**: `git commit` records changes locally, and `git push` sends them to a remote repository, enabling collaboration. These commands help maintain a detailed history of code changes.

4. **Branching and Merging**: With `git branch`, developers can create separate branches for feature development, and `git merge` allows integration of these features back into the main codebase. This keeps the workflow organized and prevents conflicts.
